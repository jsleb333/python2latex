    python2latex provides three color maps natively. They are defined in the JCh axes of the CIECAM02 color model, which is linear to human perception of colors. Moreover, three ``dynamic'' palettes have been defined, one for each color map. They are dynamic in that the range of colors used to produce the palette changes with the number of colors needed. This allows for a good repartition of hues and brightness for all choices of number of colors.

    All three color maps have been designed to be colorblind friendly for all types of colorblindness. To do so, all color maps are only increasing or decreasing in lightness, which helps to distinguish hues that may look similar to a colorblind. This also has the advantage that the palettes are also viable in levels of gray.

These properties makes it colorblind friendly for protanopia (red-blindness) and deuteranopia (green-blindness).
